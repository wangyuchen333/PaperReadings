**Introduction**  
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the profound potential to transform the world, enabling machines to exhibit human-like intelligence and creativity. Among the many challenges AI tackles, understanding how models learn in-context and synthesizing their capabilities fascinates me the most. My passion for this field, coupled with a desire to explore trustworthy and secure AI systems, has led me to pursue graduate studies in [Program Name] at [University Name].  

**Academic & Extracurricular Activities**  
My undergraduate studies at Peking University, as a member of the ZHI Class (Honors Class for Intelligence Science), have provided me with a solid foundation in computer science and machine learning. With a GPA of 87, I consistently rank in the top 20% of my cohort. Excelling in rigorous coursework like advanced mathematics, machine learning, and neural networks, I have honed my analytical and problem-solving skills. Outside the classroom, I co-organized academic workshops and actively participated in conferences to deepen my understanding of AI applications. These experiences have inspired me to tackle real-world challenges through innovative research.  

**Research Experiences**  
Driven by curiosity, I sought to go beyond coursework to contribute to cutting-edge AI research.  
- **Model Merging for Large Models**: I investigated methods like SLERP, Task Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES for merging large models, utilizing the *mergekit* library. This work revealed the challenges and potential of model synthesis, paving the way for scalable and adaptable AI systems.  
- **Decoding In-Context Learning (ICL)**: My research focuses on understanding why ICL performs effectively in large transformers. By identifying key architectural components that enable ICL and explaining its fine-tuning-level performance, I aim to contribute to designing more robust generative models.  
- **Collapse Errors in Diffusion Models**: I am collaborating on research to analyze and mitigate collapse errors in ODE-based sampling of diffusion models, a phenomenon that undermines sample quality. Our findings, expected to be published soon, provide insights into early-stage error propagation and solutions to enhance sampling fidelity.
