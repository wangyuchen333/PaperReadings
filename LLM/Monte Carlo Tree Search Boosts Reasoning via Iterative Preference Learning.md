- **Inductive Reasoning**: is a type of reasoning where a conclusion is drawn based on observations or evidence. It involves generalizing from specific instances to make a broader generalization or prediction. Inductive reasoning allows for the conclusion to be likely but not necessarily certain. It relies on the idea that if something is true for a particular set of cases, it is likely to be true for similar cases. For example, observing multiple birds with wings and concluding that all creatures with wings are likely to be birds.
    
- **Deductive Reasoning**: is a type of reasoning where a conclusion is drawn based on the truth of the premises. It follows a logical process where the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Deductive reasoning is often used in mathematics and formal logic. An example would be the premise that all mammals have kidneys, the premise that all whales are mammals, and the conclusion that all whales have kidneys.
    
- **Abductive Reasoning**: is a type of reasoning where a conclusion is drawn based on the best explanation for a given set of observations. It involves considering different hypotheses and selecting the most likely or best explanation based on the available evidence. Abductive reasoning is used to make educated guesses or hypotheses when faced with incomplete or uncertain information. For example, observing a car that cannot start and a puddle of liquid under the engine, and concluding that the most likely explanation is a leak in the radiator.
    
- **Formal Reasoning**: is a systematic and logical process that follows a set of rules and principles. It is characterized by its structured and rigorous approach, often used in disciplines like mathematics, formal logic, and computer science. Formal reasoning relies on deductive logic and mathematical proofs to arrive at valid conclusions. It involves applying established rules and principles to solve problems and make deductions.
    
- **Informal Reasoning**: is a less structured approach to reasoning that relies on intuition, experience, and common sense. It is used in everyday life situations where strict formal rules may not apply. Informal reasoning allows for more flexibility and open-ended thinking. It often involves making decisions or drawing conclusions based on personal experiences, heuristics, and contextual factors. Informal reasoning is more adaptable but may also be less reliable compared to formal reasoning.
