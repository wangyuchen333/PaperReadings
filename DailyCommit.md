4、翻译后让他润色，比如告诉他“用更美国人书面的口吻改写这段话”，“把这段话改写的更严肃礼貌一些”



研究导向硕士的录取标准与博士类似，在标化过关的前提下，科研能力是关键，因此必须突出研究兴趣。而在就业导向硕士的申请中，科研水平能展现深入思考问题和创新解决问题的能力，这对研究生学习和未来工作都大有裨益。因此，申请竞争激烈的就业导向硕士，也有必要强调科研能力。
个人品质：在文书中展示个人品质也很重要。我建议将个人品质穿插到全文的叙述中，而不是单独成段。比如说，你的个人品质是创新+合作，那你讲科研经历的时候，就可以展示自己如何提出创新方案，并有效协调团队高效执行计划。
学校契合度：这一点很重要，但是很多同学写文书常常忽略。设想一个追求安稳，厌恶风险的人，去申斯坦福这种鼓励创业的学校，斯坦福大概率不会录取，因为这违背了自己学校的文化。因此，在文书中，我们必须针对具体学校的具体项目，说明自己与这个项目如何匹配/契合。

文书架构
第一段：Introduction
第二段：Academic & Extracurricular Activities
第三段：Research Experiences
第四段：Professional Experiences
第五段：Optional
第六段：Future Goals. From 1point 3acres bbs
第七段：Why School
第八段：Conclusion. 1point3acres.com
接下来我来逐段讲解。
第一段：Introduction
这段简单介绍，为什么对某领域感兴趣，以及为什么想读某硕士项目。理工科硕士的文书开头，只需快速吸引注意力并和点名主旨，无需长篇叙述（招生官读着就烦）。我基于自己申CMU MSCV的文书，给出以下简单的例子。 ..
(Interest) Computer vision algorithms have incredible abilities to understand complex patterns and to make insightful, data-driven decisions. I am pursuing a Master's in computer vision because I am fascinated by that ability, 
(Goal) and I am confident that such an M.S. training will equip me with cutting-edge computer vision skills essential to solve real-world challenges, such as XXX. 
第二段：Academic & Extracurricular Activities. 1point3acres.com
这段强调下自己课堂学习和课外活动中的闪光点。个人建议从general到specific，先列举几个点，再总结从这些经历中学到了什么，从而为后面的段落做铺垫。基于自身经历，给一个简单的例子：
(General) My education at Wenzhou-Kean university has provided me with a solid foundation for advanced studies in computer vision.  ..
(Example1) As an undergraduate, I earned straight A’s in my math, statistics, and computer science courses.  
(Example2) Besides, I co-organized XXX conferences, served as a reviewer for XXX, was awarded XXX, and gave an invited talk about image processing at XXX.
(Impact) These experiences greatly deepened my interest in the real-world applications of computer vision. 
第三段：Research Experiences
这段讲述在校的科研经历。整段的逻辑，可以参考学术论文的摘要，但应避免过多专业术语，以清晰易懂为佳。我建议从大背景（比如实际应用）出发，引出具体问题并分析原因，接着阐述自己的解决方案，最后概括科研成果(如速度或精度提升，论文期刊发表等）。以下是一个例子。
(Transition) I aspired to go beyond coursework and identify more real-world concerns computer vision could address. 
(Background) In real-world photography, for example, I found it is challenging to XXX. 
(Problem) Inspired by that observation, I conducted a literature review on XXX and noticed that XXX. 
(Cause) Through extensive experimental comparisons, I discovered that this issue results from XXX, which is contrary to the common belief that XXX. . 1point3acres.com
(Solution) To tackle this issue, I designed a novel architecture to XXX. 
(Result) Compared with baseline methods, the proposed model achieved XXX improvement on speed/accuracy. I will present this paper at XXX conference as the first author.
第四段：Professional Experiences
这段讲实习或工作经历。与科研经历相同，重点在于建立逻辑链条，和简练陈述语言。与科研经历不同，此处需突出学术知识在业界的应用，以及自己对业界问题的深入思考，而不仅仅是模型高精度和高速度。此外，实习和工作经历要与前面的学术科研经历相呼应。最后，一定要强调自己从业界学到的技能或收获的感想。来看下面的例子。
(Transition) To further my professional experience in real-world computer vision applications, I joined the industry and became a XXX at XXX company. This professional experience taught me a great deal about XXX and XXX. 
(Skill-1: with follow-up example) Foremost, real-world data are much more complex than "clean" benchmarks. . Χ
(Background) For example, traffic light images vary widely in XXX and XXX, and are captured under diverse XXX and different XXX. 
(Problem) Manual data acquisition and labeling from miscellaneous categories are laborious and tedious. 
(Solution) Thinking outside the box, I utilized XXX to address XXX. My approach effectively solved XXX, and it improved the detection accuracy for XXX by XXX, successfully passing all real-road tests across XXX locations. 
(Skill-2: without follow-up examples)  At XXX company, I also learned to write readable, efficient code, articulate my thoughts clearly, and communicate with others using concrete statistical evidence. . .и
(Impact) Such professional skills are invaluable for my graduate studies and future work in the industry. 
第五段：Optional
这段可写可不写。如果文书篇幅较短，此段可以省略。若篇幅较长，我们分类讨论：科研实力强劲同学，可补充一段科研经历；实习经历丰富的同学，可增加一段实习内容。
第六段：Future Goals. 
这一段陈述未来计划。一个常见的误区是过于激进。例如，如果你只做过软件开发的基础实习，却将短期目标定为硬件研发主管，招生官一定会觉得你好高骛远，不切实际。另一个常见误区是过于保守。比如你大一就拿了ACM金牌，做了BAT的算法研究实习，硕士毕业后的目标却是找工能上岸就行。这会让招生官认为你缺乏驱动力，且未来发展前景有限。

接下来我来讲如何正确地写Future Goals。我们通常先写短期计划，比如获得硕士学位。接着是中期计划，比如进入某个领域的公司工作。最后是长期计划，通常是当企业高管或自主创业。来看下面的例子。
(Short-term) In the near future, I plan to complete a master's degree in computer vision. During my graduate studies, I plan to investigate XXX that XXX. I am particularly interested in applying XXX. 
(Mid-term) After graduation, I intend to work at a XXX company as a XXX engineer to advance my professional experience and further strengthen my problem-solving skills. 
(Long-term) In the long run, I aspire to found my own company in XXX, aiming to solve XXX and contribute to XXX.

第七段：Why School. 1point 3 acres
这一段强调自己为何选择某个特定学校的特定项目。以下是注意事项（1）Why School要强调自己和项目很match，而不是自己对项目很渴望（2）Why School要强调具体项目如何帮助你实现future goal（3）Why School要写的非常具体，绝对不能出现A学校的内容复制粘贴到B学校的情况。
Why School一般包括课程，科研，毕业设计，和就业服务。
课程：在项目主页搜索"curriculum"查找硕士期间可选课程，根据兴趣爱好选1-2门课程，并具体说明这些课程对你的作用。 
科研：项目主页搜"faculty"进入教授页面，依据"research interest"或者"research area"筛选出3-5位感兴趣的教授，然后到Google Scholar查找他们的代表作（一般是引用量前10的论文），如果研究方向相近，就可以在文书里提及合作的意愿。
毕业设计：项目主页搜索"capstone", 并强调该capstone对自己未来学习和职业发展的帮助。 ..
就业服务：谷歌搜索"XXX university career fairs"，找到合作企业。如果这些企业的业务方向和我们的求职方向相似，也可写入文书中。
来看例子。
(Claim) I believe XXX university's XXX program is the ideal fit for me. 
(Coursework) Foremost, XXX university's XXX program has a rigorous curriculum for XXX. I intend to take courses like XXX to strengthen my skills in tackling XXX challenges. 
(Research) Besides, XXX university's XXX program offers promising research opportunities supervised by world-class faculty. I desire to work with Prof. XXX on XXX. I also aim to collaborate with Prof. XXX on XXX. 
(Capstone) Furthermore, XXX university's XXX program offers excellent capstone projects. This capstone will give me the platform to XXX. 
(Career Services) Finally, XXX university's XXX program offers exceptional career fairs with companies like XXX. Such relationships are invaluable for my entrance into the XXX industry.

第八段：Conclusion. 1point3acres.com
. Waral dи,
这段务求简洁明了。基本原则（1）重申自己是优秀的申请者（2）强调通过该项目的学习，自己能解决什么难题，并为社会做出什么贡献（3）呼应开头的研究领域。以下是一个简单的例子。
I am confident that I am the ideal candidate for your program.  I look forward to contributing my motivation, innovation, and determination to your vibrant academic community, advancing the XXX industry, and creating positive technological impacts on society..google  и
